# Shell script for installing pre-requisite packages for solidity on a
# variety of Linux and other UNIX-derived platforms.
#
# This is an "infrastucture-as-code" alternative to the manual build
# instructions pages which we previously maintained at:
# http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html
#
# The aim of this script is to simplify things down to the following basic
# flow for all supported operating systems:
#
# - git clone --recursive
# - ./scripts/install_deps.sh
# - cmake && make
#
# TODO - There is no support here yet for cross-builds in any form, only
# native builds.  Expanding the functionality here to cover the mobile,
# wearable and SBC platforms covered by doublethink and EthEmbedded would
# also bring in support for Android, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, Tizen, Sailfish,
# Maemo, MeeGo and Yocto.
#
# The documentation for solidity is hosted at:
#
# http://solidity.readthedocs.io/

# TODO - I wonder whether all of the Ubuntu-variants need some special
# treatment?
#
# TODO - We should also test this code on Ubuntu Server, Ubuntu Snappy Core
# and Ubuntu Phone.
#
# TODO - Our Ubuntu build is only working for amd64 and i386 processors.
# It would be good to add armel, armhf and arm64.
